Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides,
Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spinout.
You saw them on the Dizzitron. They could use the practice.
I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys.
Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt.
Only the best of the best, right?
