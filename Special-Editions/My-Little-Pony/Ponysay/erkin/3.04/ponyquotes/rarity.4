Whining? I am not ‘whining’. I am complaining. Do you want to hear ‘whining’?
(whines obnoxiously) This is whining! Ooohhhh! This harness is too tight!
It's going to chafe! Can't you loosen it?! OH! It hurts and it's so rusty!
Why didn't you clean it first?! It's gonna leave a stain, and the wagon's
getting heavy! Why do I have to pull it?!
