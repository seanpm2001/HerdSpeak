The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel,
the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the
fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly
called for a topstitch, or maybe a traditional blanket stitch, and the
overall design is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French
haute couture...

But ... uh ... you know ... um ... whatever you want to do is fine...
