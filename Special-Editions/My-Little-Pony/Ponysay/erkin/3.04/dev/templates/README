xterm-colours.xcf a GIMP XCF file template that enumerates all possibles
colours and is limited to them so no other colours can be used. All
other files are templates that are combination of this and pony templates
created for the Desktop ponies project.

The pony templates was created by Bot-chan, Doctor Blade, StarStep and others
originally for 'Desktop ponies' but they mention on 'ponychan' and on they
Deviantart Desktop ponies group that anypony can use them if they give credits
and not make profit from there, respect the authors and they work.
As same time they say that ponies enough different from the templates can by 
concideres differents ponies and for that you can claim completly ownership
if these aren't from MLP:FiM or not owned by another artist.
