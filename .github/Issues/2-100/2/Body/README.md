### [Feature request] Calf/cow(file) creator

A new feature I have planned for HerdSpeak is a built-in utility for easily making Cowfiles. I want it to be doable entirely through both a CLI (the terminal) and a GUI, so that even someone who doesn't know basic HTML (or has very little computer experience) can create a cow file.

This utility should include:

- [ ] Import functionality
- Import an image and convert it to a cowfile. Since it can't just be converted to ASCII, users should be able to place the `$eyes` and other features where needed
- [ ] Export functionality
- To export the cowfile to a separate folder, or to the `Cowsay`/`HerdSpeak` program files.
- [ ] Preview functionality
- Preview the cowfile before exporting/saving it (or not, maybe it doesn't deserve to be saved)
