These files are metadata templetes for licenses that you
may use on your ponyfiles. These *cannot* be added with
ponysay-tool --edit-apply. You should add them either using
ponysay-tool --edit or with a text editor.

If you choose to add them using a text editor, add the
content between the two $$$ lines. If the files does
not start with a $$$ line, add the content to the top
of the file followed by a $$$ line and with a $$$ line
at the top.

So a ponyfile without any other metadata should begin with
something like

$$$
LICENSE: license-abbr (full license name)
FREE:    yes/no/sharable

license text/links
$$$


Do not forgot to add the source. If you make it yourself,
from scratch, almost from scratch, the tag should be, if
your username is XYZ:

SOURCE: [XYZ]
