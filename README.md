Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/<developerName>/<repoName>/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# HerdSpeak

***

## About

See above. HerdSpeak is a fully backwards compatible fork of the classic Command Line (terminal) program `cowsay` it offers the same functionality as its predecessor, but adds support for new features.

### Notable new features

#### Cowfile maker

#### MacOS port

The original Cowsay program was never ported to MacOS (Mac OS X 10.0-10.6, OS X 10.7-10.11, MacOS 10.12+) This program attempts to do this.

The MacOS port will support the following versions:

- Apple System 6
- Apple System 7
- MacOS 8.x
- MacOS 9.x
- Mac OS X 10.0
- Mac OS X 10.1

#### Other ports

There might be ports for:

#### Cowfile template

The `*.cow` format has now been standardized with a layout and basic guidelines,

##### V1 Cowfile guidelines

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# Start of script
## /<Filename>.cow
## <description_goes_here>
## License: <license-spdx-identifier>
## Author: <username> <email address> <other>
## Start of cowfile
$the_cow = <<EOC;
  <ASCII_ART_GOES_HERE>
  <$thoughts, $thoughts, $thoughts, $eyes, $udder, $tongue>
  <$borg, $dead, $greedy, $paranoid, $stoned, $tired, $wired, $young>
EOC
# End of cowfile
# File version: x (YYYYY/MM/DD @ 00:00)
# Formatting: Perl 5
# File type: Cowfile (*.cow)
# Cowfile template version: 1 (2022, Tuesday, July 5th at 4:13 pm PST)
# Backwards compatible with: Cowsay 2.x, Cowsay 3.x, HerdSpeak 1.x
# End of script
```

#### Cow Pasture

The cow pasture is a new place to store cow files. Cow files in the /usr/share/herdspeak/ directory can be searched either at the root, or any subfolders.

Along with this, there are many new default cowfiles. Cowsay 3.03 had 55 cowfiles, HerdSpeak will be able to support thousands/millions

#### Full backwards compatibility

HerdSpeak is 100% backwards compatible with Cowsay (3.03, 3.x, 2.x) the command name is just different (you have to write `herdspeak` instead of `cowsay`) other than that, it functions the same.

## Wiki

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

I unsuccessfully installed Cowsay on my Raspberry Pi in early 2022, but didn't get it to function. I then successfully installed Cowsay on Ubuntu 22.04 on 2022 July 2nd. It wasn't until the next day that I realized its potential, and how great of a program it is. So on 2022, July 4th, I created my own fork of the project, known as HerdSpeak. The project received a bit of development today, but is still far from ready.

### Alpha history

On 2022 July 5th, I standardized the cow file format, added the nursery, and made a `README.md` file for the project, along with a logo. I also imported logs of my Cowsay usage so far.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

No Modern history to show for this project.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
