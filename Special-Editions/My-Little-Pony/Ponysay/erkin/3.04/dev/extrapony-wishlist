This file is the extrapony counterpart to the pony-checklist.
If you find a non-MLF:FiM pony you would like to be included,
you can list it here, instead of making a pony request in the
issue system, especially if you have many ponies and have
write access to this repo (or is making a pull request anyway).

Ponysonas or OC from the Ponysay Developers (You have one?, I have one, eveyone/everypony have one)
	(Ponysonas is nice term, altough it sounds like being fictive [as in personas], and personally, I like to think of myself as a real pony.☺ )
	(Ponysona is a pormateau/Contraccion of: Pony and Persona, mean a special OC that identify yourself and is used for either personal use or/and in Role Playing, draws, commissions, avatar u other things, this idea was taken from the Furry Fandom where they have Fursonas that is the same idea but extended to any possible (or impossible) animal (like a pony too but these are ever less often))

[Probably rejectables but ... meh]
Rainicorn (Adventure Time) (In MANY comics/fanfic is claimed the mother of Rainbow Dash)
Keldeo (Pokémon) (alongside Rarity as they trainer...a pony training a pony or a unicorn training a unicorn)
