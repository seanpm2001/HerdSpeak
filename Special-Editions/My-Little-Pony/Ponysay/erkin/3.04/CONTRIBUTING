Contributions to ponysay is greatly appreciated.

-- Populate Equestria --

Ponysay will always need contributors to draw ponies
both from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and
other My Little Pony shows and fan media.

For a guide on this matter please refer to the info
[PDF] manual section Contributing::Providing Ponies.


-- Maintain the Canterlot Library --

The info manual is constantly updated, and will always
need to be reviewed. The info manual is written in
ponified British English, if this does not hold
for a section in the manual, or if it contains typos,
spellos, or can in general be better formulated. Please
send a patch or mention so in a commit comment.

Additionally the [tex]info manual is primarily check
in the PDF version, as it is believed to be the most
common way to view the manual. If you discover that
the info version or the HTML version looks differently,
Please send a patch, add an issue or mention so in a
commit comment.

Although translations of the primary manual (the PDF)
may not be piratically due to its constant updating,
translations of the man pages are useful if you
speak a language from where good understanding of
English is not common at all ages, orthographic
correction are appreciated as well.


-- Make new magic spells and improve existing ones --

If you want to make contributions to the pony code
itself, just make a pull request, their are much,
style-wise, to think about. However, please try to
document every new method, function and class in the
same manner is the already existing ones. Maintainability
is also important, try not to write obscure super-optimised
code, unless it is actually necessary; and comment
code segment's when it seems appropriate.
